  <h1>Project Reviews</h1>
  <p>Project Reviews enable content to be shared with other authors, Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and others. They can be shared one to one or to a group so that each person can see comments and edits made by others.</p>
  <h2>Creating a Review</h2>
  <p>Click the Review Tab and then click the + icon to start a new review.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review01.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/></p>
  <p>Enter a name for your review.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review02.png"/></p>
  <p>When you click Done, you will see a list of all the topics in your project along with various filters and options for the columns displayed.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review03.png"/></p>
  <h3>The Filters</h3>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review04.png"/></p>
  <h3>The Columns</h3>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review05.png"/></p>
  <h3>Selecting Topics for Review</h3>
  <p>You can either select all the topics by selecting the top check box or select just those you want. After the review has been sent to the reviewers you cannot add new topics to it. Create a new review for additional topics.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png"/> Initially you will need to look at reviewers comments and make the changes manually. If you make changes between submtting the topic for review and editing based on the review, you will need to allow for the differences <br/>
    Updates will add the ability to accept a reviewers changes and apply them automatically. How to handle that scenario will be covered when the functionality is added.</p>
  <h2>Send for Review</h2>
  <p>Once you have selected the topics to be reviewed, you click the Share button to access this dialog.</p>

            <li>Advise you of a qualifying address so that you can invite them using that address.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tabletext">If they attempt to log in with any other address, they will not be able to access the review.</p>

  <h2>The Review</h2>
  <h3>Invitation Only</h3>
  <p>The reviewers will each get an email by virtue of you having added their name to the list of Members or because you have emailed them with the link. As above, they must use the email address to which you sent the invitation and it must meet the criteria.</p>
  <h3>Public Review</h3>
  <p>Anyone with the link can review but they will have to use one of the options below.</p>
  <h3>Opening the Review</h3>
  <p>When the reviewer(s) follow the link, unless they are already logged in, they will be required to log in using a verified ID as below.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review14.png"/></p>
  <p>After logging in they will see a list of all the topics and when they double click on one, it will be displayed in the same way that you see in the authoring area when working on the source topics.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/reviewing/review12.png"/></p>
  <p>On the right they will see the editing tools.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/reviewing/review09.png"/></p>
  <ol class="decimal">
    <li>
      <p>The Pin icon allows the reviewer to place a pin and add a comment. Initially the pin will just have an outline but when the reviewer clicks Submit, it will be more obvious.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>By clicking the pencil icon the reviewer can drag across some text to highlight it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Click the icon and then select some text to apply strikethrough. The reviewer has to add some text explaining why they have applied strike-through to enable the Submit button.</li>
    <li>
      <p>By clicking this icon the reviewer can enter the new text in the dialog that will be displayed. They will also need to use the Pin icon to indicate where the additional text is to appear.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click this icon to replace text. Select the text and strikethrough will be shown. Add the new text below the icons.</p>
    </li>
    <li>This icon allows the reviewer to draw a free format shape.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>When using these icons the reviewer will see a red circle. Using that they can change the color of the strikethrough and other edits.</p>
  <p>Should the user click the wrong icon and want to change to another, they should click the icon again.</p>
  <p>Each editing session is uploaded to the server. If the reviewer makes an incorrect edit, they can simply make a further edit to correct their submission. The reviewer will get an email to notify them.</p>
  <h2>Actioning<span> the Review Comments and Edits</span></h2>
  <p>When a reviewer submits their response the author will receive an email advising them of the changes. The Review should then be accessed.</p>
  <p>The Active option will be selected. Click the twisty for the review you want to work on and the topics will be listed below.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/reviewing/review10.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;"/></p>
  <p>When you click a topic it will open in the center panel showing all the submissions to date on the right.</p>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/reviewing/review13.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;"/></p>
  <p>At the moment any edits made by the reviewer cannot be automatically applied to the original topic. That will be added in an update. </p>
  <p>In the initial release, the Resolve and Delete options will not be enabled. You will need to switch from Review mode to Author mode and make the changes manually.</p>
  <h2>Deleting Reviews</h2>
  <p>You can right click the review in the Active Reviews panel and select Delete. The local copy of the review will go to the recycle bin and the copy on the Adobe Cloud server goes to the recycle bin there. That copy will be deleted in accordance with Adobe&#39;s terms and conditions or you can delete it manually.</p>
