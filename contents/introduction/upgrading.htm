  <h1>Upgrading from Classic Versions</h1>
  <p>There are big changes to the code as it is now HTML5 and CSS3 based. Projects created in earlier versions will not be truly upgraded in the normal sense, instead your old project is left untouched and a copy is made on the fly. It is that copy that is upgraded. That means that you retain your project in its old format by way of a backup.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png"/> You are nonetheless recommended to retain a backup copy in either source control and/or a zipped copy.<br/>
    A zipped copy prevents you opening it accidentally and working on it before you realize it was the backup. Also you always have a clean backup that can be used to create a new clean copy time after time. Prefixing the zip file with the date is good practice. YYMMDD_MyProject.zip.</p>
  <h2>Before You Proceed</h2>
  <p>A few things you need to be aware of before you upgrade.</p>

          <p>In the Output Presets it may appear that WebHelp has been dropped. It hasn&#39;t! The difference between webhelp and responsive help is simply that webhelp does not adapt to the size of the user&#39;s screen whereas responsive and frameless help do.</p>
          <p>When you upgrade from a Classic project, any output that was using a webhelp skin will be converted to the Azure Blue responsive skin. If you were using a responsive skin in Classic, that will be converted along with any customisation that was applied using the skin editor. Any other customization will not be applied.</p>
          <p><span data-keyref="ProdName_2020">Adobe RoboHelp 2020</span> or above users can also apply frameless skins. These are recommended as they are where future development will be focused. If the output is available on the internet, Google search works better with frameless skins.</p>

  <h2>Converting the Project to <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> New UI Format</h2>
  <p>When you are ready to convert your project created in any earlier version of RoboHelp, click File &gt; Upgrade RoboHelp Classic Project and browse to the main folder of your existing project.</p>
  <p>Click Open to display the New Project dialog.</p>
  <p>After first installing <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> the Save Location will be as shown. You can change it here and optionally make the new location your default location. Note that existing projects will not be moved automatically.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/introduction/new_project_dialog.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/></p>
  <p>Complete as required and click Create.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png"/> When you upgrade, any image, media and CSS files in the root folder of your project will be moved from their existing locations into the &quot;assets&quot; folder you see below.<br/>
    After the upgrade, Assets is the default folder but you can choose to save such files wherever you prefer.</p>
  <h2>Upgrading Customized Skins</h2>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>When you upgrade any responsive skin that you applied in a Classic version of RoboHelp, any customization you applied using the skin editor will be applied. </li>
    <li>Any customization you applied other than through the skin editor will be lost on upgrade. What you can try is importing your responsive skin using the Import dialog. Make sure you click the Keep Using Older Layout of the Skin check box.</li>
    <li>Webhelp skins will not be upgraded. By default the Azure Blue responsive skin will be applied but you can change that to any of the supplied frameless or responsive skins after the upgrade. Frameless is the recommended option.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>The Upgrade</h2>
  <p>In <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> your project will look like this. You will see the same folders as before but with the addition of the &quot;assets&quot; folder.</p>
  <p class="caption"><img src="../assets/images/multi_folder/contents_01.png"/></p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeNew.png" style="border: none;"/> <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> lets you change folder and file names in File Explorer and it will be immediately reflected in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>. The change will show as soon as you put focus back on <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>. Careful though, it can break links.</p>
