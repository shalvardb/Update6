  <h1>About <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span></h1>
  <p class="emphasis1" style="margin-bottom: 6pt">The purpose of the About RoboHelp sample project is to highlight the features, explain how to use them in an easy to follow way and let you see some of them in use.<br />
    It is less detailed than Adobe&#39;s own online help but the aim is to get you going quickly. For many users it will be sufficient to get started, leaving the online help for the more detailed issues.<br />
    Use the project to test things without risking damage to your production projects.</p>
  <p class="spacer"> </p>
  <p class="emphasis2">This version of the About RoboHelp sample project is synced with <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> Version <span data-keyref="Current Version">2022.4</span>.</p>
  <h2>What&#39;s In <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>?</h2>
  <p>The new and changed features in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> are highlighted in <a href="2022.htm">What&#39;s in Adobe RoboHelp 2022</a> and explained in the topics in this project.</p>
  <p>Users upgrading from <span data-keyref="ProdName_2019">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> New UI direct to <span data-keyref="ProdName_2022">Adobe RoboHelp 2022</span> should see <a href="{ProdName_Generic}_2020_Changes.htm">Adobe RoboHelp 2020 Changes</a>.</p>
  <p>Users upgrading from a Classic version, you should also see <a href="upgrading.htm">Upgrading from Classic Versions</a>.</p>
  <h2>Upgrading New UI Versions</h2>
  <p>Upgrading refers to new versions and should not be confused with in-version updates.</p>
  <p>If you are upgrading to <span data-keyref="ProdName_2022">Adobe RoboHelp 2022</span> from <span data-keyref="ProdName_2019">Adobe RoboHelp 2019</span> New UI or <span data-keyref="ProdName_2020">Adobe RoboHelp 2020</span>, note the Import Settings options on the File menu. These allow you to import your settings into <span data-keyref="ProdName_2022">Adobe RoboHelp 2022</span>.</p>
  <h2>The Sample Projects</h2>
  <p>The sample projects can be accessed from the Starter Screen when you open <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>. With <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> already open, you can access the screen again from the View Menu.</p>
  <h3>Making Changes</h3>
  <p>Should you make changes to the sample project that you cannot reverse, you can easily get a fresh copy. Delete the broken copy that is in Documents &gt; My RoboHelp Projects and grab a fresh copy from Program Files. Don&#39;t attempt to open it from there, it will not function properly.</p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 12pt">C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe RoboHelp 2022\resources\data\template\projects\About RoboHelp.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNote.png" /> With each update, both copies of the sample project are updated.<br />
    The copy in Program Files is replaced entirely.<br />
    In the copy in My RoboHelp Projects the files that are installed are also replaced but any files you have added will be left. If you want to retain your current copy with its installed files, rename the folder in My RoboHelp Project before you apply the update or move it to another location.</p>
