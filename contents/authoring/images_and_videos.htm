  <h1>Images, Videos and Captivate</h1>
  <p>Inserting Images, Video and Captivate outputs couldn&#39;t be simpler.</p>
  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>Click in your topic where the image is to appear, then click the image icon on the authoring toolbar, browse your Project Files or Local Files or paste a link to the image and click insert.</p>
  <p>You can also just drag the file from the Contents Panel into your topic.</p>
  <p>Most image formats are supported including SVG and Google&#39;s WebP format. Click the file type dropdown in Project Files or Local Files to see the full list.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_bottom_only" height="43" src="../assets/images/images/images_02.png" width="461"/></p>
  <p>The preview has a caption field that can be left blank but it&#39;s essential if you are using <a href="cross_refs_and_links.htm">Cross References and Links</a>.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/images/images_01.png"/></p>
  <p>You can position the image, add a border and so on by clicking the image and going to Properties. By default the figure caption will appear below the image but you can change that in Properties as shown below.</p>
  <p>On import, the size of the image will be its true physical size. You can change the size it displays at in the topic by changing the dimensions in the fields shown below. That does not change the true image size allowing you to show the image at different sizes in different topics if required.</p>
  <p>If you tick the Use Thumbnail check box shown below, two further fields will be displayed. There you can define the size of the thumbnail as it will appear in Preview and your online outputs. In Printed Documentation, it will be the same size as when you are in Author mode.</p>

  <h3>Image Maps</h3>
  <p>Image maps can be used for many things. For example, they can be a great way of providing help for a software screen.</p>
  <ol style="list-style: decimal;">
    <li>Create an image of the screen and add it to a topic as described above.</li>
    <li>Select the image and an additional icon will appear in the toolbar.<br/>
      <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/map_icon.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>Click the icon to display the mapping dialog. Select the shape you want, rectangle, circle or polygon.<br/>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Rectangle</span> - Click the rectangle icon and drag from one corner to the diagonally opposite corner.<br/>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Circle</span> - Click the circle icon and drag to create the circle.<br/>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Polygon</span> - Click the polygon icon and click where it is to start. Drag to the next point and click again. Repeat until you have the shape you want and double click the final point to stop drawing.<br/>
      <br/>
      If any mapped areas need to overlap, use the four toolbar icons highlighted blue to set the priority.<br/>
      <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_and_bottom" src="../assets/images/images/image_map_01.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>When you have finished creating your shapes or after you create each shape, select the area and click the Link icon to display this dialog.<br/>
      <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_only" src="../assets/images/images/image_map_linking.png"/>
    </li>
    <li>To change the link target, double click the focus area and link to the new target.</li>
    <li>To change the map shape, select the shape and click the dustbin icon.</li>
    <li>To change the map size, select the shape and use the drag icons.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Video</h2>
  <p>The process for videos is the same as for images.</p>
  <p>Click in your topic where the video is to appear, then click the Insert Multimedia icon on the authoring toolbar, browse your Project Files or Local Files or paste a link to the video and click insert.</p>
  <p>You can also just drag the file from the Contents Panel into your topic.</p>
  <p>Most video formats are supported. Click the file type dropdown in Project Files or Local Files to see the full list.<br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_only" src="../assets/images/images/media_02.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>You will see a preview that you then click Insert. At a basic level, that&#39;s it.</p>
  <p>You can position the video, add a border and so on by clicking the video and going to Properties.</p>
  <h2>Captivate</h2>
  <p>Click File &gt; Import &gt; Adobe Captivate Demo and browse to the demo you want to insert. You can browse to the CPZ or ZIP file created by Captivate or the HTM/HTML file that launches your demo. <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> will take what it needs and the demo will show in the Contents Panel.</p>
  <p>Click the Insert Multimedia icon and click Adobe Captivate Demo, then browse to the demo you imported.</p>
  <p>You can also just drag the file from the Contents Panel into your topic.</p>
  <p>Click Insert. That&#39;s it!</p>
  <p>You can position the demo, add a border and so on by clicking the demo and going to Properties.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
