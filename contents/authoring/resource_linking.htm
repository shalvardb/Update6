  <h1>Resource Linking</h1>
  <p>Resource Linking replaces the Resource Manager that was in earlier versions. It does much the same job and provides a means of accessing various files such as images that are maintained by another part of the author&#39;s organization and are liable to change.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;"/> When you upgrade a Classic project, any resources being used will be brought into your new project and be linked. You will need to create links as below to any folders and files that were not in use at the time of the upgrade.</p>
  <h2>Linking Folders and Files</h2>
  <p>Simply right click in the Contents Panel and click Link &gt; Link File or Link Folder and browse to what you want to see in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> . In this image a folder has been added.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/resource_linking.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/></p>
  <p>Just drag any image into any topic as required.</p>
  <p>Whilst the arrow remains green, you know what you are using is in sync with the source. If it appears red, then the source has changed but your topic will not automatically update. It may be the source has been changed in preparation for say a new corporate image but for now you want to continue using the old version, that&#39;s OK. When you are ready to use the updated image, click the menu icon that displays while hovering over an image and click Sync.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeTip.png" style="border: none;"/> After you have linked a folder, you may see many resources that you know you will never want. You can delete those from the list of linked files. Hover over the image and click Delete in the menu. This does not delete the file from the source, just from what you see in your project.</p>
  <p class="spacer"> </p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;"/> What you see in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> is a snapshot of the files at the time the folder was added to <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>. New files added to the source folder later will not be shown but any you need can be added.</p>
  <p class="spacer"> </p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;"/> Do not rename a linked folder or file in either the source location or <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> as that will break the linking.</p>
