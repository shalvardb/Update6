  <h1>Project Settings</h1>
  <h2>General</h2>
  <p>Change any of these values to your own preferences.</p>
  <p>Do Not Allow Inline Formatting is a good way of enforcing adherence to CSS styles only.</p>
  <p>Enable Advanced HTML HELP Options adds a section to the TOC properties. See the <a href="../toc_index_glossary/toc.htm">TOC</a> topic.</p>

  <h2>Topic Status</h2>
  <p>A number of statuses are preset. To add a new one, enter the name at the top and click the + icon.</p>
  <p>Use the trash icon to remove any you don&#39;t want. Make sure they are not in use first by clicking in the Topic List report and selecting the Status checkbox.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_top_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/settings_status.png" /></p>
  <h2>Colors</h2>
  <p>Colors can be set for fonts, borders, backgrounds and so on, anywhere you see this option.</p>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_bottom_only" src="../assets/images/authoring/settings_colors01.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;" /></p>
  <p>A number of colors are preset. To add a new one, click the icon highlighted above and enter a name, then click the + icon.</p>
  <p>Use the trash icon to remove any you don&#39;t want. Make sure they are not in use first. Use Find and Replace and set the search to work at code level.</p>
  <p>In a project upgraded from a Classic version you will see the colors that were defined in that project.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_top_and_bottom" src="../assets/images/authoring/settings_colors02.png" /></p>
  <p>Use the sliders to adjust or set a color. As you do so, the RGB and hex values will change. Use the A (alpha) setting to adjust the opacity of the color.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, click and release the eye dropper, then move the mouse to select whatever color is picked up by the cross hairs. These will be surrounded by a large circle displaying the color that will be defined when you click again.</p>
  <p>New colors can be added to the swatch from Project Settings.</p>
  <p>To close the swatch dialog, click outside the area or press the Escape key.</p>
  <h2>Tag Groups</h2>
  <p>A number of groups are preset. To add a new group, enter the name at the top and click the + icon.</p>
  <p>Use the trash icon to remove any you don&#39;t want but be aware that will delete all the condition tags in the group. Make sure they are not in use first by check Reports &gt; Condition Tags.</p>
  <p>In the Conditions panel, only those groups with tags defined will be shown.</p>
  <p><img class="spacing_top_and_bottom" src="../assets/images/authoring/settings_taggroup.png" style="font-size: 10pt;" /></p>
  <p>How to use Tag Groups is described in <a href="../single_sourcing/single_sourcing.htm">Single Sourcing</a>.</p>
  <h2>Font List</h2>
  <p>Generally when authoring a topic the fonts will be defined in the CSS used for the topic. Sometimes though you need to apply an inline font. You can limit the list of fonts that appears in Properties  &gt; General &gt; Font or you can prioritize certain fonts to appear first.</p>
  <h3>To Prioritize the Listed Fonts</h3>
  <p>Simply enter the names of the required fonts. You can add multiple fonts to one line using a comma to separate them. Then if the user does not have that font installed, the next font in the list will be used.</p>
  <p>Set like this, these fonts will show above the normal list of fonts.</p>
  <p><img class="Spacing_Top_Only" src="../assets/images/authoring/settings_fontlist.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" /></p>
  <h3>To Limit the Listed Fonts</h3>
  <p>Select the Do Not Include System Fonts In The Fonts List check box. </p>
  <h3>Copying the Fonts to Another Project</h3>
  <p>Using File Explorer, you will find fontlist.xml in Project Folder &gt; Settings. You can copy that to other projects. If you are familiar with the XML structure, you can also edit the file in a text editor.</p>
  <h2>Panels</h2>
  <p>There are various panels in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> showing all the options but you may not need all of them. For example:</p>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>If you do not create Microcontent, you will not need that option.</li>
    <li>If you do not create CHM files, you will not need Window Settings that are further down the list.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><img class="Spacing_Top_Only" src="../assets/images/authoring/settings_panels.png" style="cursor: nesw-resize;" /></p>
  <h2>Citations</h2>
  <p>Select the required style from the dropdown list.</p>
