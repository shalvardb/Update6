  <h1>Microsoft HTML Output - CHM</h1>
  <p>Notwithstanding its age, this format refuses to die. It is still popular where the help has to accessible offline and contained in a single file.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;"/> CHM files do not understand CSS3 standards so a copy of the css used is converted to CSS2 on the fly. This may mean the output is not exactly as designed.</p>
  <h2>Creating a CHM</h2>
  <p><img alt="" border="0" class="spacing_top_and bottom" src="../assets/images/outputs/chm01.png" style="cursor: nwse-resize;"/></p>
  <div data-conref="../assets/snippets/Path.hts"> </div>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img alt="" border="0" src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png" style="border: none;"/> Whilst you can create a Publish Location for this output, CHM files cannot be run from a server and this option should not be used for that purpose. Typically it will be used to deliver it to developers. How this is set up is described in <a href="publishing.htm">Publishing</a>.</p>
  <h2>Windows</h2>
  <p>To create or edit the window for Microsoft HTML Help (CHMs), click Outputs and select Window Settings.</p>
  <p>Existing windows will be listed and you can create new ones by clicking the + icon.</p>
  <p>Double click a window shown in the Project Component Panel to edit it or hover over it and click the menu icon that will be displayed.</p>
  <p>You will then see the various settings that can be applied. Please refer to the <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span> online help for details.</p>

  <h2>Section (Book) and Topic Icons</h2>
  <p>By default all sections will have a book icon and all topics will have a page icon. In <a href="../authoring/project_settings.htm">Project Settings</a> you can enable Advanced HTML Help Options, then in the <a href="../toc_index_glossary/toc.htm">TOC</a> you can define section and topic specific icons.</p>

  <h2>Search Not Working?</h2>
  <p>Some users have reported that after generation the search tab is present but does not give any results. This and other issues can be caused by incorrect registration of the DLLs.</p>
  <p>First try<span> </span><a href="https://www.helpndoc.com/step-by-step-guides/how-to-download-and-install-microsofts-html-help-workshop-compiler/" target="_blank">MJ&#39;s Diagnostics - Helpware Wiki - KB (helpwaregroup.com)</a>. That will report any missing DLLs and there is an option to re-register them.</p>
  <p>You may also need to reinstall the Microsoft Help Compiler. That is no longer available from Microsoft it can be downloaded from the Web Archive.</p>
