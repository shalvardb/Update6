  <h1>Knowledge Base Output</h1>
  <p class="emphasis1"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeNote.png"/> The <a href="outputs_knowledge_base.htm">Knowledge Base Output</a> replaces the Content Only output for generating Atlassian Confluence, Salesforce, Servicenow, Zendesk, Zoho and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) outputs. Content Only remains for XHTML outputs.</p>
  <p class="emphasis2"><img src="../assets/images/BadgeWarning.png"/> Before creating any of the Knowledge Base output types, you must have an account set up with whichever service you use. Setting up those accounts is outside the scope of this topic.</p>
  <h2>Creating a Knowledge Base Preset</h2>
  <div data-conref="../assets/snippets/New_Outputs_New_Preset_Types.hts"> </div>
  <p>When you create the preset, you will need to select the target type, Salesforce, Servicenow, Zendesk or Zoho. You will then see that target in the options on the left and in the Target dropdown. If you will be generating to more than one knowledge base service, create a separate Knowledge Base preset for each type.</p>
  <h2>Before Configuring the Preset</h2>
  <p>You will need to have a Publish Profile set up for whichever service(s) you use. <a href="publishing.htm">Publish Profiles</a> are set up from the Edit menu.</p>
  <h2>General Settings</h2>
  <p><img height="342" src="../assets/images/outputs/kb_general.png" width="738"/></p>
  <p>According to which Knowledge Base type you selected when creating the preset, you will see that type where Salesforce is shown above. The different types are described below.</p>
  <div data-conref="../assets/snippets/Path.hts"> </div>
  <h2>Content</h2>
  <p><img src="../assets/images/outputs/kb_content.png"/></p>
  <h3>AEM</h3>
  <p>AEM will show the TOC as designed in <span data-keyref="ProdName_Generic">Adobe RoboHelp</span>.</p>
  <h3>Atlassian Confluence</h3>
  <p>Confluence has the concept of Spaces which can be thought of meaningful categories/folders/containers to organize your content.</p>
  <p>Content can be published in these spaces in different Pages that can be nested under other pages to create a hierarchy of content in the form of a page tree. </p>
  <p>The topics in the TOC will be published in the same structure as a page tree under the specified Page.</p>
  <p>If no page is specified, then content is published in the root of the selected space.</p>
  <h3>Salesforce and Servicenow</h3>
  <ul class="disc">
    <li>Do not have a concept of levels so any structure in the TOC will be ignored and the topics will be presented as a straight list.</li>
    <li>Do not permit the use of javascript within articles so your content must not use dropdown text, expanding text or thumbnail images. Dropdown and Expanding Text content will be preserved but not in that format.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Zoho</h3>
  <p>Zoho allows 5 levels of nesting in the TOC.</p>
  <p>On the Zoho site, a section (book) in the TOC can contain either articles or other sections but not both.</p>
  <h4>Allowed</h4>
  <p>Section(Book)1<br/>
       Section(Book)2<br/>
